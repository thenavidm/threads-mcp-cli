## 1.1.2, 2026-10-04

- **`npx -y @thenavidm/threads-mcp-cli` starts the MCP server whatever order npm keeps.** npx starts whichever binary the npm registry lists first when they share one file, and the registry does not keep the published order. For this package that happened to be the server; for 23 others it was the CLI. A third binary named after the package, on its own file, now always starts the server, and npx picks it by name.

## 1.1.1

`--port` only accepted `--port=8787`. Written the ordinary way, `--port 8787`
fell through to the default and bound 8787 anyway, with nothing printed. A flag
that is silently ignored is worse than one that errors: the server comes up, the
port is wrong, and nothing says so.

Both spellings now work, in both places that read the flag. The second was
`login --port`, which INSTALL.md tells you to reach for when 8788 is already
taken during setup — so the fault sat on the first command a new user types.

One parser now serves both, with 13 tests covering the equals form, the space
form, an absent flag, a trailing `--port` with nothing after it, a prefix that
merely starts the same way, and a typo that used to be able to bind `NaN`.

There is deliberately no `--host` flag. Binding a public interface takes
`THREADS_HTTP_HOST`, an environment variable someone has to mean, rather than a
word typed next to `--http`. A Threads token can post as you.

## 1.1.0

A second surface, and a new name to match it.

### The CLI

Every one of the 30 tools is now also a shell command. `threads-cli` lists them,
`threads-cli <command> --help` derives the flags from the same Zod schema an MCP
client is handed, and `threads-cli schema <command>` prints that schema so you
can check the two surfaces really are one thing. They read the same `ALL_TOOLS`
array through the same handlers and the same `WriteGuard`, so a tool added
tomorrow is a command tomorrow.

`--confirm` is the shell spelling of the confirmation posting and deleting
require. `--json`, `--compact` and `--agent` cover machine output, `--select
a,b.c` keeps only the fields you asked for, and errors are JSON on stderr
whichever you pick.

Exit codes a script can branch on without reading prose: 0 ok, 2 bad arguments
or a refused write, 3 not found, 4 the token was rejected, 5 the Threads API
failed, 7 rate limited, 10 nothing configured yet. `doctor`, `login` and
`refresh` are reachable from the CLI binary, because they are what someone
types when nothing works yet.

The point of the second surface is what it costs. The MCP server sends all 30
tool definitions on every turn, measured at ~9,450 tokens. A command sends
nothing until you type it.

### Renamed to threads-mcp-cli

The package is now `@thenavidm/threads-mcp-cli` and the repository is
`thenavidm/threads-mcp-cli`. `@thenavidm/threads-mcp` is deprecated on npm and
points at the new name. The binaries are unchanged: `threads-mcp` for the server,
`threads-cli` for the shell.

Every GitHub link also moved from the old account name to `thenavidm`. The old
one only resolved through GitHub's rename redirect, which stops working the
moment someone else claims it.

### Claude Desktop extension

`desktop-extension/build.sh` produces a `.mcpb` that installs on a double click.
It vendors its own dependencies rather than shelling out to `npx`, and its
`user_config` takes a pasted token, a username and a read-only switch. Leave the
token empty and it picks up the refreshable one `login` wrote.

## 1.0.0

First release. TypeScript, 30 tools, 57 tests.

### Four things Threads does differently

**Publishing is two calls with a gap in the middle.** A container is created,
it processes asynchronously, then it is published. Publishing into that gap
fails with an error that says nothing about timing, which is why so much Threads
automation works on text and breaks the first time someone attaches a video.
The container status is polled rather than slept on, starting at 500ms and
backing off to 4s, so text publishes almost immediately and a five-minute video
still works.

That unpublished container is also the only draft state Threads has: invisible,
valid for 24 hours, publishable later by id. Exposed as `stage_post` and
`publish_staged` rather than hidden inside a helper, because showing a human a
post before it is public is worth a tool of its own.

**The 500-character limit is not `String.length`.** Meta caps a post at 500
characters and counts emoji as UTF-8 bytes. A family emoji is one character to a
reader, eleven UTF-16 code units, and 25 bytes. So 130 of them is 130 characters,
comfortably inside the cap, and 3,250 bytes, which is refused. Both limits are
measured separately with `Intl.Segmenter`, and the error names which one was
crossed and by how much.

This matters most for `create_thread`. Threads has no thread endpoint: a thread
is ordinary posts chained by `reply_to_id`, so it can half-publish and nothing
rolls it back. Every part is validated before the first is published, and if a
later part still fails the error names exactly how far it got and gives back the
last published id.

**There is no edit.** No endpoint changes a published post. Fixing a typo means
delete and repost, losing the replies, likes and reposts, and spending one of
the 100 deletions the account gets per rolling 24 hours. That is why nine tools
refuse to run without `confirm: true`, and why `stage_post` exists.

`delete_post` uses HTTP DELETE. Sending POST to the same path returns a
success-shaped response for a request that deleted nothing.

**Tokens die on a 60-day clock.** A long-lived token can be refreshed once it is
24 hours old and never after it expires, and an expired one is replaced only by
walking the whole OAuth flow again. `threads-mcp login` stores the token where
the server can reach it, and it is then refreshed automatically inside the last
seven days of its life, plus reactively when Meta answers 190/463. A token
pasted into a client config cannot be refreshed by anything, and the docs say so
rather than letting it lapse quietly.

### Setup is one command

`threads-mcp login` opens the authorisation page, catches the redirect on a
loopback listener, exchanges the code, exchanges the short-lived token for a
60-day one, verifies it against `GET /me`, and writes it at mode 0600. The Meta
app itself still has to be created by hand, and the README walks through it,
including the Threads Tester role that everyone forgets and that makes every
call return empty until it is accepted.

`threads-mcp doctor` probes each capability separately rather than reporting one
verdict: publishing, replies, insights, keyword search, profile discovery and
geo-gating each get their own line, because Threads' permissions are granular
and a missing one usually reads as an empty result rather than an error.
`threads_keyword_search` is the worst of them, since Meta silently narrows an
unapproved search to your own posts, so both `doctor` and `search_keyword`
detect that case and say so.

### Output is a tenth the size

Listings render as tagged text rather than Graph API JSON. Timestamps are
normalized from Meta's `+0000` offset format to ISO-8601 UTC so they compare,
every attribute is escaped, quoted and reposted posts nest rather than
flattening, and hidden replies render as hidden so a gap in a conversation is
visible instead of implied.

### One tool that is not an endpoint

`get_top_posts` fetches recent posts, pulls insights for each, and ranks by
engagement against views. Sorting by raw likes mostly ranks posts by age.
Threads reports views alongside likes, replies, reposts and quotes, which makes
a real engagement rate possible, and nothing surfaces it by default.
