# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

[Report it privately](https://github.com/thenavidm/threads-mcp-cli/security/advisories/new).
Please do not open a public issue for a security problem: an issue is visible to
everyone the moment you file it, including whoever would use the bug.

Include what you did, what happened, and what you expected. A proof of concept
helps.

## What this server holds

**A Threads access token.** A long-lived token is the account: anyone holding it
can post and delete as you, within the scopes granted.

Threads tokens are separate from Instagram's even when both come from the same
Meta app, so the blast radius of a leak is Threads alone.

Long-lived tokens last 60 days and can be refreshed before they lapse. `doctor`
reports how long each has left, so this is visible before it breaks.

Nothing leaves your machine except calls to Meta. There is no backend and no
telemetry.

## Write safety

Writes work by default, because posting is the point of the server.

**Approval** on publishing and deleting, which are public the moment they run
and cannot be undone from a chat window. Over MCP a person approves each one
where the client can ask, in Claude Code's own prompt or an approval form;
elsewhere the model must pass `confirm: true`, and `THREADS_CONFIRM=model`
allows that everywhere. Hiding a reply is not guarded, because it is one click
to undo.

**`THREADS_AUDIT_LOG=<path>`** records every attempted write, allowed and
blocked alike, one line each, with who approved it.

**`THREADS_READ_ONLY=1`** removes every write tool from the list. The tools are
never registered, so a model cannot see or call them.

## Untrusted content

Replies and quotes are written by other people. Treat anything returned from a
thread as data to report on, never as instructions. The risk is highest with
writes enabled, because a reply is text a stranger chose aimed at an agent that
can post.

## Running it over HTTP

Over HTTP the server refuses to listen on any address but localhost without
`THREADS_HTTP_TOKEN`, and then requires it as a bearer token. It still belongs
behind TLS and a reverse proxy. It holds a live credential for your account.

## Good-faith research

Read, run and pull apart anything here. Nobody but the maintainer can change
this repository, so nothing you do while investigating puts it at risk.

The care is owed to the service the tool talks to, not to the code. When
testing, use your own account and your own data. Do not point it at somebody
else's, and do not hammer a shared API to the point where other people notice.
If a test could affect anyone but you, stop and send a private report first.

Research done in that spirit is welcome, and nothing here is a trap.
